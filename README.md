# Mod1-project-London
Mod1 project with Sara
We wre working on London House Sales Data from Zoopla.

The Deliverables
There will be three deliverables for this project:

A well documented Jupyter Notebook containing any code you've written for this project and comments explaining it. This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project.

A short Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides presentation (delivered as a PDF export) giving a high-level overview of your methodology and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders. Make sure to also add and commit this pdf of your non-technical presentation to your repository with a file name of presentation.pdf.

A Live Demo of your non-technical presentation. You will have an opportunity to practice and get feedback the day before the final presentation so that you grow more confident on your speaking skills.
